```Arrow``` is Lightweight library toolbox for Java and Android Development. Basically it groups utilites and helper classes commonly used for mobile development. Most of them have been extracted from popular java libraries like ```Guava``` or ```Apache Commons``` plus other stuff added myself. Refer to the Main Features section for a fully explanation of its capabilities.

Main Features
-----------------
- **```Optional<T>```:** An immutable object that may contain a non-null reference to another object. Each instance of this type either contains a non-null reference, or contains nothing (in which case we say that the reference is "absent"); it is never said to "contain null". <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained#optional" target="_blank">Refer to Guava ```Optional<T>``` documentation.</a>

To enable Arrow, add your dependency in your ```build.gradle``` file:

```java
